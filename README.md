# reddit-wordcloud
This program will create a wordcloud using the post titles on the front page of reddit.


To run the program, download and unzip the project folder then cd into the reddit wordcloud folder and run:
```
    cd reddit-wordcloud
    python reddit_scraper.py
    python reddit_wordcloud.py
```

One file scrapes the data you need, and the second file generates the wordcloud for you.
